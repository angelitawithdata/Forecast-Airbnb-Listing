# Forecast-Airbnb-Listing

This project explores Airbnb dataset that is publicly available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/), I started with explorations of the data, including feature engineering, building and evaluating models. An evaluation of different modelsâ€™ results is provided at last based on prediction performance, using root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE) as the evaluation metric. 

This time there are 5 main models, so please [Open Me!](https://github.com/angelitawithdata/Forecast-Airbnb-Listing/blob/main/OpenMe.ipynb)https://github.com/angelitawithdata/Forecast-Airbnb-Listing/blob/main/OpenMe.ipynb)
